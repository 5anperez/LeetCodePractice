prob 174

I tried to implement my own version of the function, but it is not behaving like your correct version because when I pass in the table "[[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]" my version incorrectly returns 6, but the correct answer is 7, which is what yours returns. Can you help me debug why mine is incorrect? Here is my version: 

'''
    
    
    
def minCapitalRequired(invPeriod):
    if not invPeriod or not invPeriod[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(invPeriod), len(invPeriod[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

    # Base case initialization
    dp[0][0] = max(1, 1 - invPeriod[0][0])

    # Initialize first row and column with the cumulative requirement
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = max(1, dp[0][j-1] - invPeriod[0][j])
    
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = max(1, dp[i-1][0] - invPeriod[i][0])

    # Populate the DP table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            required_if_came_from_left = max(1, dp[i][j-1] - invPeriod[i][j])
            required_if_came_from_top = max(1, dp[i-1][j] - invPeriod[i][j])
            dp[i][j] = min(required_if_came_from_left, required_if_came_from_top)

    return dp[m-1][n-1]






'''
Your implementation contains a **subtle but significant error** in how it initializes and propagates the `dp` table. Specifically, the issue lies in your **base case initialization** and how the values propagate. Let’s walk through the problem and debug it.

---

### **Issue 1: Incorrect Base Case**

In your version, you initialize the base case at the top-left corner (`dp[0][0]`) as:
```python
dp[0][0] = max(1, 1 - invPeriod[0][0])
```
This is correct for the very first cell, but it doesn't account for how the initial requirement propagates into the rest of the table. 

In this specific problem, the health required at each cell depends on the **minimum health needed to survive at the destination cell**, not just the cumulative sum of the previous health. This is where your propagation logic diverges.

---

### **Issue 2: Propagation Logic for the First Row and Column**

In your version, you initialize the first row and column using:
```python
for j in range(1, n):
    dp[0][j] = max(1, dp[0][j-1] - invPeriod[0][j])
```
```python
for i in range(1, m):
    dp[i][0] = max(1, dp[i-1][0] - invPeriod[i][0])
```
This logic assumes that the robot must cumulatively reduce or increase the health as it moves along the row or column. However, the correct approach is to calculate the **minimum health required** to safely move forward, which isn't necessarily a cumulative calculation.

---

### **Issue 3: Propagation Logic for Internal Cells**

When calculating the required health for a cell (`dp[i][j]`), your version assumes:
```python
required_if_came_from_left = max(1, dp[i][j-1] - invPeriod[i][j])
required_if_came_from_top = max(1, dp[i-1][j] - invPeriod[i][j])
dp[i][j] = min(required_if_came_from_left, required_if_came_from_top)
```
While this looks reasonable, it doesn’t consider that **`dp[i][j]` represents the health needed at the current cell to safely move forward** (not the health needed to reach this cell).

---

### **Correct Logic**

The health at any cell `dp[i][j]` represents the **minimum health required to leave this cell and survive all the way to the goal**. This depends on the **minimum health required** at the next steps (either right or down). The correct propagation formula for the DP table is:
```python
dp[i][j] = max(1, min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) - grid[i][j])
```

This backward-looking logic ensures that the robot survives regardless of whether it moves right or down.

---

### **Fixing Your Implementation**

Here’s the corrected implementation:

```python
def minCapitalRequired(invPeriod):
    if not invPeriod or not invPeriod[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(invPeriod), len(invPeriod[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

    # Base case: health required at the goal
    dp[m-1][n-1] = max(1, 1 - invPeriod[m-1][n-1])

    # Initialize the last row
    for j in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        dp[m-1][j] = max(1, dp[m-1][j+1] - invPeriod[m-1][j])

    # Initialize the last column
    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
        dp[i][n-1] = max(1, dp[i+1][n-1] - invPeriod[i][n-1])

    # Fill the rest of the DP table
    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            required_if_came_from_right = dp[i][j+1]
            required_if_came_from_down = dp[i+1][j]
            dp[i][j] = max(1, min(required_if_came_from_right, required_if_came_from_down) - invPeriod[i][j])

    return dp[0][0]
```

---

### **Explanation of Changes**

1. **Base Case**:
   - Start at the bottom-right corner:
     ```python
     dp[m-1][n-1] = max(1, 1 - invPeriod[m-1][n-1])
     ```

2. **Last Row and Last Column**:
   - These are initialized **backward**, moving from the goal to the top-left:
     ```python
     dp[m-1][j] = max(1, dp[m-1][j+1] - invPeriod[m-1][j])
     dp[i][n-1] = max(1, dp[i+1][n-1] - invPeriod[i][n-1])
     ```

3. **Rest of the Table**:
   - Each cell depends on the **minimum health required** in the cells to the right and below it:
     ```python
     dp[i][j] = max(1, min(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j]) - invPeriod[i][j])
     ```

---

### **Test Case**

Using your test case:
```python
grid = [[-2, -3, 3], [-5, -10, 1], [10, 30, -5]]
print(minCapitalRequired(grid))  # Should output 7
```

---

### **Why Was Your Version Returning 6?**

Your implementation propagated the **current required health** as a cumulative total, which fails to properly account for cells further down the path. Specifically:
- It didn’t correctly back-propagate the health needed for survival at the goal.

By fixing the propagation logic, the correct answer (7) is obtained.
